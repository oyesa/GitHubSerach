### Description
GitHub Search is a website where a user can search for a GitHub account holder and their repositories using their GitHub user name. 

### Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
The program should return a user's profile details when the correct username is entered in the User Profile section.
    Input Example:"Oyesa "
    Output Example: "Oyesa's information is displayed"

When the user clicks on the 'view repository in GitHub' button, it should redirect them to the github site for that repository.

When the user clicks on 'Visit Github Site' on a user's profile they should be redirected to the user's github site.
