### Description
GitHub Search is a website where a user can search for a GitHub account holder and their repositories using their GitHub user name. 

### Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
The program should return a user's profile details and repositories when the correct username is entered in the User Profile section.
    Input Example:"Oyesa "
    Output Example: "Oyesa's information and all repositories are displayed"

When the user clicks on the 'view repository in GitHub' button, it should redirect them to the github site for that repository.



### Setup/Installation Requirements
* Access your Github account
* Fork the repo from https://github.com/oyesa/GitHubSearch
* Clone the link
* Open the link 

* Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
* Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
* Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
* Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
* Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.


### Technologies Used
* HTML was used in making the skeleton of the website.
* CSS and Bootstrap was used in styling the document.
* Vscode was the source code editor of choice.
* Git and Github were used as my local and online repositories respectively.
* AngularCLI was used in creating the components/classes/directives/pipes needed in the web-app
* Github's API and Access Token was used in creating the connection to Github.
